bulgarian-holidays.el
=====================

Defines the official public (non-working day) holidays in Bulgaria.
Also includes the most popular Bulgarian Orthodox Church observances
(commonly called "[patron saint] name days", these have â€  as prefix),
and a few other common or international holidays (with * as prefix).
When church or other holidays are also non-working days, they do not
start with a prefix (e.g. Easter or April Fool's Day).
